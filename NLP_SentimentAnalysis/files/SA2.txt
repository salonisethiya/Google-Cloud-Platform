Wireless Networking is relatively cheaper than wired Networks since they require no cables between the computers as well as lower long term costs due to less maintenance since there is less equipment. The reduction of cables also reduces the trip hazard caused by cables running along the floor in most homes.Wireless Networking is also very mobile and versatile.Wireless networks can easily be set up and dissembled.
Since wireless networking is a relatively new and contingent form of networking, it is filled with it own hazards and problems such as unreliability and security.Wireless networks have limited bandwidth, hence they cannot support Video Teleconferencing(VTC).
